# Git-Practice

## Introduction
Working with version control is an essential part of any software team. Since we're not exactly sure how familiar new students will be with Git, included in this documentation is a link to several quick guides/tutorials. This repository exists to provide a playground of sorts - a repository without any serious project that our team can use to ensure new students can push, pull, merge, and make issues correctly. 

## Recommended Reading
The GitHub Guides are very nice resources. It is up to you to evaluate your knowledge level and choose the appropriate guide, if any

## First Task
Add your name in the new students.txt file. Do this the proper way - create an issue, a matching branch, etc.  

## Second Task
Using HTML and CSS, re-create the screenshot of the webpage in this repository. Use header tags, a table, an img tag, paragraph and div tags
